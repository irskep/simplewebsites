# Operationally Simple Web Sites

This site is about how to put together a web app using sturdy, simple, modern technology. It will be cheap to deploy, and keep working long-term. Optimize for _shipping_, not just _building_.

If building your web site is your full-time job, this guide is not for you. It's for people who are learning the ropes, or people building side projects where the point is to ship a product rather than to play around with technology.

# What does operational simpicity mean?

### Few moving parts

A bicycle is easier to fix than a car. The fewer individual pieces there are, the easier it is to understand and fix problems.

## Dependencies that don't require ongoing upgrades

Some popular frameworks have made major backward-incompatible changes to their APIs and build tools within the past couple of years. One way to avoid dealing with these changes is to use simpler frameworks with simpler tooling needs.

## Battle-tested tools

There is no reason to use "cutting-edge" technology to build 99% of web applications. If you use tools with great documentation and many answers on Stack Overflow, it will be easier to find solutions to your problems.

# Why bother with operational simplicity?

- Fighting your tools distracts you from working on the actual problem
- Abstraction layers make debugging more difficult and obscure what's really happening

# Surely you'd have to sacrifice UX and developer productivity?

Not really, depending on what you're doing. There's nothing special about frontend JavaScript frameworks that makes them "more powerful" than what web browser APIs can do natively.

The value of a frontend JS framework is in how it lets you organize your code, breaking down UI into components and breaking up business logic into conceptual chunks. The value of a build tool is in letting you organize your code the way you want to, and in using framework-specific syntax.

# Why you should listen to me

I've been making web sites for over twenty years. [Here's proof!](https://imaciscool.neocities.org/)

I've built large production web frontends from scratch in JavaScript, and small production web backends from scratch in Python. On top of being a professional software engineer, I'm also an obsessive hobbyist. Most recently, I made [DIYBand.net](https://diyband.net), a web site builder for bands. I also made [Browserboard](https://browserboard.com), which is an online whiteboard that I've since sold. Before that, I did a bunch of wild stuff for startups that have since died. :smile:

# The state of the site (it's early)

I'm still thinking out loud here, trying to figure out what the right message is.
