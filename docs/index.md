# Let's cut through the noise

This site is about how to put together a web app in as un-trendy a way as possible. I wrote it because I think people get taught how to do web development in a really weird way these days, and I want to provide an alternative that leaves folks with a better idea of what they're doing.

This site does **not** have step-by-step tutorials on how to write JavaScript or how to put your first Flask app together. It's about how to make good choices so that when you want to get fancy or keep your site running for a long time, you don't run into walls.

## Why you should listen to me

I've been making web sites for over twenty years. [Here's proof!](https://imaciscool.neocities.org/)

I've built large production web frontends from scratch in JavaScript, and small production web backends from scratch in Python. On top of being a professional software engineer, I'm also an obsessive hobbyist. Most recently, I made [DIYBand.net](https://diyband.net), a web site builder for bands. I also made [Browserboard](https://browserboard.com), which is an online whiteboard that I've since sold. Before that, I did a bunch of wild stuff for startups that have since died. :smile:

I also have experience working with people early in their programming journey, and I have some view of how they get tripped up.

## Why be ordinary?

When you use cutting-edge technology, you're committing to at least a few years of change, and taking on risk that a technology will be abandoned. When you use "old" technology that hasn't changed in a long time, you have a stronger guarantee that it will continue to work well into the future, and that it will be compatible with new things. You'll be able to find good answers to common questions on Stack Overflow.

In general, your needs are not unique. Many have trodden these paths before. Follow in their footsteps.

## The state of the site (it's early)

I started writing yesterday. It's public because it's easy to publish. Hooray for the internet!
